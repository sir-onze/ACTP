<h1> Problem </h1>
<p>In the middle of the night, four adventurers encounter a shabby rope-bridge spanning a deep ravine.For safety reasons, they decide that no more than 2 people should cross the bridge at the sametime and that a flashlight needs to be carried by one of them in every crossing. They have onlyone flashlight. The 4 adventurers are not equally skilled: crossing the bridge takes them 1, 2, 5,and 10 minutes, respectively. A pair of adventurers crosses the bridge in an amount of time equalto that of the slowest of the two adventurers.One of the adventurers claims that they cannot be all on the other side in less than 19 minutes.One companion disagrees and claims that it can be done in 17 minutes.</p>

<h2> TP1 </h2>
<p>1. modelthe system above using what you learned about timed automata;</p>
<p>2. express inCTLthat it is possiblefor all adventurers to be on the other side in 17 minutes;</p>
<p>3. express inCTLthat it is impossiblefor all adventurers to be on the other side in less than17 minutes;</p>
<p>4. test these formulae inUPPAAL;</p>
<p>5. write a report that explains your model, your formulae, and the conclusions obtained (about1-2 pages excluding images).</p>
<h2> TP2 </h2>
<p>1. model the system above using what you learned about monads, in particular the durationand list monads;</p>
<p>2. show that it is indeed possiblefor all adventurers to be on the other side in 17 minutes;</p>
<p>3. show that it is impossiblefor all adventurers to be on the other side in less than 17 minutes.</p>
<p>Your second task is to compare your approaches viaUPPAALand viaHaskellto the problemof the adventurers. Specifically, you should provide strong and weak points of the two approaches:what are the (dis)advantages of UPPAALfor this problem? What about Haskell? The comparison should be around 300 words.</p>
